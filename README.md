TÜBİTAK 2209/A Research Project, including autonomous logistic robot car which can be monitored by mobile app.
## About
An autonomous robot project which is supported by TÜBİTAK (Tübitak 2209A). This autonomous vehicle scans the area to find the box defined in the system and keeps scanning until it bumps into the right box(s). Scanning is done with the help of an ultrasonic sensor. Robot recognizes the box with an RFID card attached to it. When the robot finds the right box, it lifts the box automatically and carries it to the rack defined in the system. This vehicle, also, can be controlled by an Android phone using the mobile app. Mobile app communicates the vehicle via bluetooth. If robot hits a wall (or an irrelevant object), it returns and keep searching.

## Used Technologies
- C++, in order to program Arduino UNO card
- Java & Android, in order to make the mobile app
- Servo motor and other electronic circuits
